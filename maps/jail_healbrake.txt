First of all, I have worked about this map for sometime and I think I have become bold, hehe. 

About the map: 
8 CT spawns. 
24 T spawns in 12 cells. 

Map contains several things that all JailBreak map has: 
Cage and Cells. There is one weapon in cells. One vent from cells to pool. 
Simple/Short pool, because I don't see the point of it. 
*Boxing ring. 
Simple KZ. 
Gunroom with 5 weapons. 

And now something new, maybe never seen in JailBreak maps: 
Ice hockey rink - I have never liked to play soccer in jailbreak, so I thought it would be more fun to play hockey. 
Trampoline LongJump - Jump as far as you, simple game rules are on wall. 
Luck-o-Meter - one of my favourites, try your luck, if you are lucky enough you will live, else you will be smashed. 
Race - simple race, run as fast you can. 
Hurdles relay - I was playing hurdles races, but it wasn't fun at all, so I added relay - a C4 that you have to give your teamnate. 
Scissors-Rock-Paper - simple game. 
*Mini aim_map - for nasty players who want to kill their teamnates in headshot. Safety first - T aren't allowed to leave with weapons. Almost forgot, you can add Earthquake effect for players. 
*Thunderdome - Mad Max movie, where two men enter, one man leaves. I could say it's a maze or labyrinth. 
*Air fight - A place with reduced gravity. 

* - /box mode on. 

I think it's all, report any bugs. 
I know about 3 skye glitches, where you can see through, but aint gonna fix them.
