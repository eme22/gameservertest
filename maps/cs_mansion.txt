Installation
Simply extract to your \Steam\SteamApps\youremail\counter-strike source\cstrike\maps folder.

My first map for cs_source, really a remake of the classic cs map and influenced by
cs_estate.  Roughly 3 weeks of work were put into it.  

*NOTES*

Power box in basement will toggle the 1st floor lights (some of them).

4 hostages total, 1 in the basement, 2 on the first floor, and 1 on the 2nd floor.  

Rescue point is in ct spawn.  

Have fun!
