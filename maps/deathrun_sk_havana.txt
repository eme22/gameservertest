____________
map by Skals (Albert Naumovs)
Version 1.2 of deathrun_havana
____________
differences:
Arrows for directions (for noobs).
Some shortcuts removed.
Secrets Added.
Players no longer get stuck in walls.
No problems with "ghost" plugins.
____________
The map takes place in Havana where the player has to jump and run across several ledges, 
platforms and rooftops within the map to eventually reach the teleporter that will lead them 
above the map where the terrorist is. All the shortcuts in the map are intentional, 
there are a few longjumps you can do to skip small portions of the map to make your run quicker, 
but it's up to you weather you take the risk or not.
