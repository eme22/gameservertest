CrazyCar_v2 - Fight to the death
Mapping  by Nathaniel Miller AKA NIPPER
Textures by: Half-life/Counter-strike

Some Prefabs by Yak_Fighter (truck is modified)

DONT TAKE THIS MAP SERIOUSLY!
CTs have the crazycar and Ts have go-carts 
and a Hummer.....USE THEM!

In the cave up the ramp there is a Bigwheel
bike jump the ramp with it and get on top 
of the cliff. Use the buttons on top to set off 
bombs in the map.
