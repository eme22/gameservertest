Deathrun_pyramid <--- 7th deathrun map by pukata.

History of the map: In aincent time at the old egypt a faro named tut died. His peoples burried him in the pyramid along with many tressures. But they didnt leave the pyramid without protection. They left some aincent traps in the pyramid and got some guardians to use the traps if someone tryed to break in the pyramid and try to steal tuts tressures. 

Cts/tressure hunters. Break into the temple and reach the tomb in middle of the pyramid. While u are trying to reach the tomb you have to avoid the traps in the pyramid. When u reach the end pick up a gun and shoot the guardians so you can get the tressures safe out of the pyramid.

ts/guardians. Protect tuts tomb whatever it takes. Kill the tressure hunters with the traps that are build in the pyramid. If not they will shoot you and you will be coursed forever!

All: have fun in my 7th deathrun map.
