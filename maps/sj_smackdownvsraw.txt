The concept is simple - a soccerjam map in a WWE Arena.

CTs are the "Smackdown" superstars, Ts are the "RAW" superstars.

The goal is the middle minitron for both sides. There are 2 ladders for each team to use to their advantage and 1 placed in the ring.

As extra props, there are Smoke and HE Grenades surrounding the ring. Use them to your team's advantage too.

Lastly, you can simulate the ring entrances of CM Punk and Edge, with their own theme music! (for WWE fans)

If you have any problems/enquiries/suggestions to improve the map, drop me an e-mail at jgyj95@hotmail.com
