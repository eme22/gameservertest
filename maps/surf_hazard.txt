Welcome to surf hazard...do not take the cheese.

ABOUT THE BONUSES: There are 4 bouses scattered around the map that you must complete 
in order to enter the final room at the end. There is no bonus on level 1 because i thought 
that level was hard enough.

Hints for bonuses:
Bonus 1 (level 2) - Perhaps there is a shortcut to avoid the first strafe structure?
Bonus 2 (level 3) - Hmm can you get on top of something?
Bonuses 3&4 (levels 4 and 5) - Make the rings go DING! DING! BITCHES!

Map difficulty: even i can't do it very well. (much harder than mindspin)
